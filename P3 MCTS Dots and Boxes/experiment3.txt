Experiment 3

We commented out the while-loop that enables the time feature, 
just make sure to comment out the for-loop before it.

When we first thought about doing time, we thought it would be a great idea. 
However alloting 1 whole second for a single move is way too much considering
how the bots don't take a drastic amount of time (even at 1000 num_nodes). We
do know that our mcts_modified tree will be smaller than the mcts_vanilla tree,
because we've set break points to allow our bot to auto-pick clearly good moves.
So just with this set, we know the tree will stop growing and be smaller.

If the time limit was at 0.1s or less, the bots won't be able to fully expand
their tree and will have to make a decision off the available nodes. In most cases
the modified version will still trump vanilla due to a smart-picking constraint that
eliminates all moves that could lead to a potential score for the opponent (unless 
there are NO good moves).
